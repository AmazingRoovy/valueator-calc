# ALINAtor-3000 - math helper (Calculator)
My first full project work on Qt platform, demonstrates results of one week's working on this base. ALINAtor-3000 - is a calculator with pleasent violet-pink design, which title has been inspired by my girlfriend. So, it was unussual present for intenational woman's day, and I really proud of my work.

It has some troubles with double-values accuracy, connected with C++ lang typelogy, it will be fixed in future, I sure. Also, it is my first serious repository on GitHub source, and I'm really impressed by this fact.

Also, I haven't done some exceptions with specialities of working with types in C++, I hope, that I'll fix them.
